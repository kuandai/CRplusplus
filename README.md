# CR++
A simple recreation of Cosmic Reach in C++. Might not get anywhere and is simply a project for me to learn OpenGL.

# Dependencies
- GLFW
- GLEW
- SDL2

# Build requirements
- A C++ compiler (Note: The Makefile uses `g++` by default, it is necessary to modify it if you plan to use a different compiler.)
- make
- zip
- xxd
- libglfw-dev (glfw-devel on Fedora/derivatives)
- libsdl2-dev (SDL2-devel on Fedora/derivatives)
- libglew-dev (glew-devel on Fedora/derivatives)
- libspdlog-dev (spdlog-devel on Fedora/derivatives)
- rapidyaml-devel on Fedora/derivatives. There does not appear to be a package for apt/dpkg
